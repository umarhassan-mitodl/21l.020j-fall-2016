For Session 2:

**Required: Listen to the first 25 minutes of Sen's talk. Consider:**

What are some of the problems engendered by thinking of globalization as a Western phenomenon? Why does Sen see such categorization as wrong?

_If you want to continue listening to the Sen lecture (not required):_

25-­45 minutes: Why does Sen reject interpretations of globalization as “good” or “bad” for the poor of the world?

46-­52 minutes: In the 1960s, South Korea and Ghana had relatively similar and underdeveloped economies. South Korea zoomed ahead in the following decades, while Ghana’s economy barely improved over the same time period.

To what does Sen attribute this difference?

**Required: Read Chanda: Intro and Ch. 1. Consider:**

What role do you—as part of your family—have in global history?

Chanda shows the journey of his ancestors on the map on p. 12. Can anyone in the class trace the journey of his/her ancestors?

What are some of the theories about why the first humans left Africa?

Using what you have read, do you think early human migration was a conscious effort to move from one place to another? Why? Why not?

What template or categories will Chanda use to examine globalization? Explain.
