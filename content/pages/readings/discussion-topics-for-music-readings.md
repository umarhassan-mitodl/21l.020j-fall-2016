On Session 11, [Prof. Patty Tang](http://mta.mit.edu/person/patricia-tang) of Music and Theater Arts will be in class with us to discuss world music and authenticity. The assignment for the next session is to read Prof. Tang’s article “Negotiating Performance in Senegalese Popular Music,” Byrne’s “I Hate World Music” and Garofalo’s “Whose World, What Beat.”

As you read these articles, think about the quote on Youssou N’Dour’s promotional t-shirt:

“The most important thing we own is our culture. Don’t trade away your culture for anything in the world.”

What does this mean in terms of world music? Other arts?
