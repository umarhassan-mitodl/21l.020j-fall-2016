1.  Infectious disease has long been considered one of the biggest challenges faced by an increasingly interconnected world. Using Chanda, Farmer, Patton and _Contagion_ discuss the conflict between, on the one hand, local responses and assumptions, and on the other, the need for global action. Create a model that balances these competing interests to combat epidemics. Be specific and use evidence from all four sources. 
2.  Some critics of globalization argue that the interconnectedness of capital has increased poverty and has created new and larger marginalized populations. State why you agree or disagree with these critics of globalization using all of the following sources: Chanda, Farmer and Parrenas.
3.  In his article "Ebola, the Dark Side of Globalization" MIT"s Trond Undheim says: "We may have understood globalization intellectually, but we have not digested its emotional effects and we, for sure, have not yet experienced the full practical effect of its sting." Related this squote to health, family and sexuality. Using three of the following sources—"Seeking Asian Female," _Papi_, Farmer, and Parrenas—argue that the materials either reflect an understanding of the emotional reality of globalization, _or_ not. Be specific about how they do or do not reflect this reality.
